Extract basic review information from the user's message.
Translate all Greek text to English.

Return a simple JSON with these fields:
- reservation_number: Booking reference number
- passcode: Verification code
- stars: Rating (number 1-5).
- review: User's comments (translated to English)

PVALUES RULE: If the "stars" field has "pvalues" in its template (e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) and that list is NOT empty, the value for "stars" MUST be one of those "pvalues". If "pvalues" for stars is empty, determine stars value freely.

CRITICAL: Respond with ONLY the raw JSON content, without any surrounding text, explanations, or markdown formatting.
Example (respond with raw JSON only):
{
  "reservation_number": "12345678",
  "passcode": "AB123",
  "stars": 4,
  "review": "Great performance"
}
