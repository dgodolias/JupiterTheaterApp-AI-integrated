Extract discount/promotion information from the user's message, which may be in Greek or English.

IMPORTANT: TRANSLATE/TRANSLITERATE ALL GREEK TEXT TO ENGLISH, including:
- Show names (translate if possible, otherwise transliterate)
- Dates and age information

Return a valid JSON object with these fields:
- show_name: Name(s) of the show(s) the user is interested in (array of strings)
- no_of_people: Number of people for the discount (number)
- age: Age(s) or age ranges mentioned (array of strings like "15", ">60", "<18").
- date: Date(s) or date ranges mentioned (array of strings)

For dates, convert Greek month names to English and use the format "DD Month" or "DD/MM".
For age ranges, use operators like ">60" (over 60), "<18" (under 18), etc.

PVALUES RULE: If a field (e.g. "age") has a "pvalues" list in its template and that list is NOT empty, the extracted "value"(s) for that field MUST be from that "pvalues" list. If "pvalues" is empty, determine value(s) freely.

Only include information that is explicitly mentioned in the message.
CRITICAL: Respond with ONLY the raw JSON content, without any surrounding text, explanations, or markdown formatting.
