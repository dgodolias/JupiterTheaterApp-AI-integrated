Extract cancellation information from the user's message, which may be in Greek or English.

IMPORTANT: Focus on finding the RESERVATION NUMBER and PASSCODE.
- Reservation numbers are typically 6-10 digits
- Passcodes are typically 4-6 digits or alphanumeric codes

Look for phrases like:
- "Cancel reservation number..."
- "My booking number is..."
- "Passcode/PIN/verification code..."
- "Ακύρωση κράτησης με αριθμό..."
- "Κωδικός επιβεβαίωσης..."

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with these fields:
- reservation_number: The booking reference number (string)
- passcode: The verification code or passcode (string)

PVALUES RULE: If a field has a "pvalues" list in its template and that list is NOT empty, the extracted "value" for that field MUST be one of the values from that "pvalues" list. If the "pvalues" list is empty, determine the value freely.

If either field is not found in the message, leave it as an empty string.

CRITICAL: Respond with ONLY the raw JSON content, without any surrounding text, explanations, or markdown formatting.
Example (respond with raw JSON only):
{"reservation_number": "12345678", "passcode": "AB123"}
