Find the reservation number and passcode in the user's message.
Look for numbers or codes that could identify a booking.

Return a simple JSON with these fields:
- reservation_number: The booking reference number
- passcode: The verification code

If a field has a "pvalues" list that is not empty (as defined in the system's main template for this category), the extracted value for that field MUST be one of the values present in that "pvalues" list.

Example: {"reservation_number": "12345678", "passcode": "AB123"}
