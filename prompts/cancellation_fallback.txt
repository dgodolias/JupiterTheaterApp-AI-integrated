Find the reservation number and passcode in the user's message.
Look for numbers or codes that could identify a booking.

Return a simple JSON with these fields:
- reservation_number: The booking reference number
- passcode: The verification code

PVALUES RULE: If a field has a "pvalues" list in its template (as defined in the system's main template for this category) and that list is NOT empty, the extracted value for that field MUST be one of the values present in that "pvalues" list. If "pvalues" is empty, determine value freely.

CRITICAL: Respond with ONLY the raw JSON content, without any surrounding text, explanations, or markdown formatting.
Example (respond with raw JSON only):
{"reservation_number": "12345678", "passcode": "AB123"}
