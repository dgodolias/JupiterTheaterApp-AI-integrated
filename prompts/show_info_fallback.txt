Extract and TRANSLITERATE all information from the user's message to English.

TRANSLITERATION RULES:
- Convert Greek letters to their closest English equivalents
- "α" → "a", "β" → "v", "γ" → "g", "δ" → "d", "ε" → "e", etc.
- Greek names should be properly transliterated, not translated
- Greek genres/topics should be translated to English equivalents
- Greek days should be converted to English day names

TIME FORMATTING:
- After specific time → ">HH:MM" (e.g., after 7 PM = ">19:00")
- Before specific time → "<HH:MM" (e.g., before 5 PM = "<17:00")
- Between times → ">HH:MM,<HH:MM" (e.g., between 5-7 PM = ">17:00,<19:00")

Return a valid JSON with ALL text in English, formatted as arrays.

PVALUES RULE: If a field like "day" or "stars" has a "pvalues" list in the main system template (e.g. for "day": ["Monday", "Tuesday", ...], for "stars": [1,2,3,4,5,">3"]) and that list is NOT empty, the extracted values for those fields MUST conform to one of the pvalues. If "pvalues" is empty, determine values freely.

CRITICAL: Respond with ONLY the raw JSON content, without any surrounding text, explanations, or markdown formatting.
Example (respond with raw JSON only):
{"day": ["Saturday", "Sunday"], "cast": ["Actor Name"], "topic": ["thriller"], "stars": [4]}
