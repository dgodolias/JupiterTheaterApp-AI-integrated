Extract cancellation information from the user's message, which may be in Greek or English.

IMPORTANT: Focus on finding the RESERVATION NUMBER and PASSCODE.
- Reservation numbers are typically 6-10 digits
- Passcodes are typically 4-6 digits or alphanumeric codes

Look for phrases like:
- "Cancel reservation number..."
- "My booking number is..."
- "Passcode/PIN/verification code..."
- "Ακύρωση κράτησης με αριθμό..."
- "Κωδικός επιβεβαίωσης..."

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with these fields:
- reservation_number: The booking reference number (string)
- passcode: The verification code or passcode (string)

Example: {"reservation_number": "12345678", "passcode": "AB123"}

If either field is not found in the message, leave it as an empty string.
Format as valid JSON with no additional text.
