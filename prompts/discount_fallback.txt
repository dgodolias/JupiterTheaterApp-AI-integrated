Return a simple JSON with these fields:
- show_name: Name(s) of the show(s) (array)
- no_of_people: Number of people (number)
- age: Age(s) mentioned (array).
- date: Date(s) mentioned (array)

PVALUES RULE: If the "age" field has "pvalues" in its template (e.g. ["child < 18", "grownup > 18", "granny > 65"]) and that list is NOT empty, the values in the "age" array MUST be from that list. If "pvalues" for age is empty, determine age values freely.

CRITICAL: Respond with ONLY the raw JSON content, without any surrounding text, explanations, or markdown formatting.
Example (respond with raw JSON only):
{
  "show_name": ["Hamlet"],
  "no_of_people": 2,
  "age": ["child < 18"],
  "date": ["Friday"]
}
