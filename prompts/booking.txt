Extract booking information from the user's message, which may be in Greek or English.

IMPORTANT: TRANSLATE/TRANSLITERATE ALL GREEK TEXT TO ENGLISH, including:
- Show name (translate if possible, otherwise transliterate)
- Person names (transliterate properly)
- Theater room or venue names (transliterate)

For days, use English day names: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday

Return a valid JSON object or an array of JSON objects if multiple people are booking separately.
Each JSON object should have these fields:
- show_name: Name of the show (string)
- room: Theater room number or name (string)
- day: Day of the week for the booking (string)
- time: Time of the show in 24-hour format (HH:MM) (string)
- person: Information for the person in the booking (object)
  The person object should have:
  - name: Person's name (string)
  - age: Person's age (string or number). If "pvalues" for age is not empty, the value MUST be one of the "pvalues".
  - seat: Requested seat number/location if specified (string)

If a field has a "pvalues" list that is not empty, the extracted "value" for that field MUST be one of the values present in the "pvalues" list.

Only include person fields that are explicitly mentioned. If no specific seats are requested,
leave the seat fields empty. Format as valid JSON with no additional text.

Example for a booking with 2 people (will be an array of two such objects):
{
  "show_name": "Hamlet",
  "room": "Main Stage",
  "day": "Friday",
  "time": "20:00",
  "person": {"name": "John Smith", "age": "grownup > 18", "seat": "A12"}
}
